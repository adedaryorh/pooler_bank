This Pooler Bank application is a prototype for traditional core banking applications.

Dear Reviewer, kindly note that I do not factor in much Consideration for the SQL injection threats here, since am not using a Native Query but an ORM implementation. Also, the CSRF is taken care of with Spring Security.

Furthermore, I plan to improve this further accordingly.
